# Teensy Backdoor By Taylor Christian Newsome

This script, designed for Teensy payload conversion, processes a binary executable file to make it compatible with the Teensy microcontroller for keyboard emulation. It base64-encodes the input file and splits it into 8KB chunks, each converted into a series of "echo" commands for seamless typing by the Teensy in a Windows command prompt. Additionally, it generates two VBScript files: remove.vbs, which removes extraneous characters from the base64 output, and unpack.vbs, which decodes the base64 string back into its original binary format. The script ensures compatibility by converting files to DOS format and organizing all outputs into a converted directory. With this tool, the Teensy can automate payload delivery in a controlled and efficient manner, ideal for testing or educational purposes.
